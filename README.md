## 📌 Project Overview

The **Superbike Business Intelligence KPI Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project focused on analyzing superbike models based on their technical specifications, performance metrics, and market positioning.

This dashboard provides deep insights into:

- 🏍️ Engine Performance
- ⚡ Power & Torque Comparison
- ⚖️ Weight & Performance Ratio
- 🚀 Speed Capabilities
- 🏆 Model Classification & Benchmarking

The goal is to transform raw superbike specification data into meaningful analytical insights for comparison and performance evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Compare superbike models based on engine capacity
- Analyze horsepower & torque performance
- Evaluate power-to-weight ratio
- Classify bikes by category (Sport, Naked, Touring, etc.)
- Identify high-performance benchmark models
- Visualize model trends across years

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Tracked

- 🔥 Engine Capacity (CC)
- ⚡ Horsepower (HP)
- 💪 Torque (Nm)
- ⚖️ Weight (kg)
- 🚀 Top Speed
- 📊 Power-to-Weight Ratio
- 🏆 Performance Index Score

All KPIs are dynamically calculated using DAX measures.
